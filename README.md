# react-native-eqc
A price calculator developed using react-native framework.

I developed this app for a friend who needed a pricing calculator for business. I decided to use react-native as my cross platform development framework.

I've used react-native with react-redux library. This app can help you understand the concepts of using stateless components and how redux works.

There may be better way of doing some implementations so feel free for a discussion :).

Happy coding!
